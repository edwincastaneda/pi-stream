* After the announcement of the IP addres the display is used to show some status information . There are three different kinds of status messages:
    * **green background color**: Everything is good (e.g. IP address, streaming status)
    * **yellow background color**: Attention, there seems to be a problem (e.g. scarce free memory, not soundcard identfied)
    * **red background color**: critical error (e.g. not network connection, no connection to the stream server)
