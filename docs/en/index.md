# Assembly

We recommend adding a LCD-display as it used to show status information and most importantly the current IP-address of the machine. It is certainly also possible to get hold of the IP-address in other, slighty more complicated, ways.

We built an enclosure to shelter the computer, the display and the cables.

## LCD-display

We use [this 16x2 LCD kit from adafruit.com](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1110).

## Enclosure

* Install spacer
    
I glued a piece of wood with the approximate size of the Raspberry to the bottom of the enclosure.

* Adding holes
    
Cut holes in the side of the enclosure so the connectors fit.

* Cover for the connectors

To protect the board and the display cut out covers and glue them onto the enclosure.
